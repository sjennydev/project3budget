## Brainstorm
we were able to come up with a wireframe. we explored the possiblities of a single page app and a multipage app. But we decided to go with a single page app.
you can check out the [prototype here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/75a029fe-067b-444a-6b76-80ab67b24e2a-0391/#access_token=eyJ4NXUiOiJpbXNfbmExLWtleS0xLmNlciIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.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.Nke9uAmfcgrucC3ZaZ9B4rovxLnfMbM8FoQ6DSXssd_-RmIQj91jrHoJJXIgQL6YlMkTy8IsQ9_BbGpf27o9oibwPhogC7pCajn6f72Ma_sKHEr_2xy3U-ATenx3c2NbxaeeZw67_Usvu3OAgs8QF8yHRNCDMIuwfjug7QOeLrfwn71zjrqNltEOBjGU3BwoOFdR9O4BLnZm1madD7FDsVXBK9GjgVQCQbXWcqkuD4U-pqb8Ua8MGovlRB0gxkGu3wyLwvIxoCQElrnHyWKgoqdCbI1o2-0Zgf7GYIBIIePfpGfQ6qjyHKE8FXBvUWMuw4Np6otUvViqIUdc7LbZlQ&token_type=bearer&expires_in=86399993)

## Journey
We tried to make our components in its own separated files but we couldn't get to render anything. We couldn't figure out what was missing that wasn't allowing us to render anything. After alot of time spent debugging we decided to just start a new repo and get a clean slate.container-app
here is the link for our [first repo](https://github.com/sjennydev/project3)

## Issues We Faced
Finding time to meet was super tough during the holidays.

Getting the hang of making branches and pushing to dev branch also was tough at the beggining.

We wanted to use webpack but needed more practice and understanding

## Takeaways
Working with other developers really helps to understand to write good readable code so other poeple can continue with your work.

Collaboration sessions with team helped to start the project in our seccond attempt and bouncing off ideas was great.

At the beggining was a bit hard but later on our team got together and you could see that the team was commiting and putting the best effort while working in the project.

We definitely gained more experience and understating of commiting often, making branches, and merging pull requests.
